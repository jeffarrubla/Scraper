I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.</p>\n\n<p>Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.\nI am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Information for Bounty</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.</p>\n\n<p>In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  </p>\n\n<p>In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks to Everyone</strong></p>\n\n<p>This has been a fun questions with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.</p>\n\n<p>As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.

This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don''t want any answers along the lines of "this is how you loop an array with <code>foreach</code>".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For a long time I assumed that <code>foreach</code> worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.</p>\n\n<p>Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href="http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9">Test case 1</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $item) {\n  echo "$item\\n";\n  $array[] = $item;\n}\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh">Test case 2</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;\n  echo "$item\\n";\n}\n\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. <em>But...</em></p>\n\n<p>If we look in the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php">manual</a>, we find this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right... this seems to suggest that <code>foreach</code> relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we''ve just proved that we''re <em>not working with the source array</em>, right? Well, not entirely.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy">Test case 3</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn''t affect the loop\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo "$item\\n";\n}\n\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\n/* Output\n  array(4) {\n    [1]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    ["value"]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    [0]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n    ["key"]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n  }\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  bool(false)\n*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can''t be true - if it was, then <a href="http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9">test case 1</a> would loop forever.</p>\n\n<p>The PHP manual also states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, lets find out what that "unexpected behavior" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd">Test case 4</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo "$item\\n";\n  each($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href="http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL">Test case 5</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo "$item\\n";\n  reset($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the "copy of source" theory.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>\n\n<p>Please can someone explain what is going on here?

A lovely pony!”, and run away.</p>\n\n<p>I do keep looking for a PHP tutorial that isn''t awful, full of disastrously terrible practices, but I''ve yet to find anything I can recommend.</p>\n\n<p>Dear reader, can you perchance help me out? Unlike previous questions, I''m not after a security-specific tutorial for people who can already code in PHP; I''m looking for a good tutorial (sites or books) for those new to the language, that happens to be solid on security and writing readable code. I want the reader to be able to learn PHP properly from the start, not to have to say “well you can learn it <em>here</em>... but then afterwards you''ll need to go to <em>this other tutorial</em> to find out about the bad habits and fundamental misunderstandings you''ve just picked up”.</p>\n\n<p>(*: they don''t say that. It is not my real name.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I want a tutorial that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Uses HTML-escaping consistently from the start. The very first “Hello, your_inputted_name!” example should be using <code>htmlspecialchars()</code> correctly. This should not be introduced as an afterthought in a separate security chapter. There should be no HTML-injection hole anywhere in the given example code.</p></li>\n<li><p>Either uses SQL-escaping consistently from the start, or parameterised queries. If SQL-escaping is used it should be correct escaping such as <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> if the database is MySQL. I do not want to see <code>addslashes()</code>. There should be no SQL-injection hole anywhere in the given example code.</p></li>\n<li><p>More generally, the tutorial should understand the problems to do with putting a string inside another string, and treat escaping as a matter of correctness, not merely of security. That is to say there is no reason a user called N''gwale O''Reilly should be prevented from having an apostrophe in their name, or from talking about the HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in their message like what I''m doing now; they merely just need the right form of encoding when they''re output.</p>\n\n<p>The tutorial should explain that when a string goes into a new context it needs an encoding process appropriate for that context, like <code>htmlspecialchars()</code> in HTML output; it should not regard less-than symbols as ‘evil’ and attempt to ‘sanitise’ them away. I don''t want to see <code>strip_tags</code>. I absolutely don''t want to see misguided ‘security’ measures like looping over the <code>$_GET</code> array removing punctuation characters, or blanket-applying haphazard output-stage escaping to an input stage.</p>\n\n<p>There is so much bad code and bad examples like this out there, even in learning materials that are supposed to be explicitly about security. As questions on SO have proved it is difficult to fix people''s miunderstanding of how and when string escaping needs to happen once they''ve learned a quick hack ‘solution’ from some misconceived ‘PHP Security’ site or book.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don''t want to see <code>eval()</code>. I don''t want to see <code>system()</code>. Nothing good comes of having these in a tutorial!</p></li>\n<li><p>There should be proper separation of active logic and page markup. I don''t mean they have to be kept religiously in different files or using a specialised templating language, but I do at least want the actions up at the top and the page down at the bottom with only display logic inside it. I don''t want to see an <code>echo</code> or <code>print</code> hidden inside the guts of some program logic.</p></li>\n<li><p>Actually I don''t really want to see <code>echo</code>/<code>print</code> used at all except as the only thing in an output block. PHP is a templating language, there is no reason to go about creating complex strings of HTML then echoing them. This only encourages the use of unescaped <code>"&lt;p&gt;$var&lt;/p&gt;"</code>-style interpolation, and makes it difficult to follow.

However while I''m fully capable of developing the program I''m pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here''s a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well).</p>\n\n<h2>Databases</h2>\n\n<p>At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything''s jumbled into one database - although I''ve been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p>\n\n<h2>Caching</h2>\n\n<p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it''s cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don''t change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p>\n\n<p>My question on this:</p>\n\n<p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p>\n\n<h2>Finally</h2>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I''m pretty sure it''s a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

How about you?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>\nThanks for the responses so far. I would like to comment on people voting against detecting iPad mini versus 2 as Apple has uhm, one guideline to rule them all. Okay, here''s my reasoning why I feel it really makes all sense in the world to know if a person is using an iPad mini or a 2. And do with my reasoning what you like.</p>\n\n<p>The iPad mini is not only a much smaller device (9.7 inch versus 7.9 inch), but its form factor allows for a different usage. The iPad 2 is usually held with two hands when gaming unless you''re <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_facts">Chuck Norris</a>. The mini is smaller, but it is also much lighter and allows for gameplay where you hold it in one hand and use another to swipe or tap or whatnot. As a game designer and developer myself, I''d just like to <strong>know</strong> if it''s a mini so I can choose to provide the player with a different controlscheme if I want (for instance after A/B testing with a group of players). </p>\n\n<p>Why? Well, it''s a proven fact that the majority of users tend to go with the default settings, so leaving out a virtual thumbstick and putting some other tap-based control on the screen (just giving an arbitrary example here) when the player loads up the game for the first time is what I, and probably other game designers, would love to <strong>be able to</strong> do.</p>\n\n<p>So IMHO this goes beyond the thick fingers / guidelines discussions and is just something Apple and all other vendors ought to do: allow us to uniquely identify your device and <strong>think different</strong> instead of <strong>following</strong> guidelines.</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

The obstacle I''ve run into now is how to play sound effects.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a port of an old Macintosh game, and because of its age, the requirements are few in number:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Play and mix multiple sounds,</li>\n<li>Play the same sample multiple times, possibly overlapping playbacks</li>\n<li>Interrupt playback of a sample at any point</li>\n<li>Preferably play WAV files containing (low quality) raw PCM, but I can convert these, of course</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My first approach was to use the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element and define all sound effects in my page. Firefox plays the WAV files just peachy, but calling #play multiple times doesn''t really play the sample multiple times. From my understanding of the HTML5 spec, the &lt;audio&gt; element also tracks playback state, so that explains why.</p>\n\n<p>My immediate thought was to clone the audio elements, so I created the following tiny javascript library to do that for me (depends on jquery):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Snd = {\n  init: function() {\n    $("audio").each(function() {\n      var src = this.getAttribute(''src'');\n      if (src.substring(0, 4) !== "snd/") { return; }\n      // Cut out the basename (strip directory and extension)\n      var name = src.substring(4, src.length - 4);\n      // Create the helper function, which clones the audio object and plays it\n      var Constructor = function() {};\n      Constructor.prototype = this;\n      Snd[name] = function() {\n        var clone = new Constructor();\n        clone.play();\n        // Return the cloned element, so the caller can interrupt the sound effect\n        return clone;\n      };\n    });\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now I can do <em>Snd.boom();</em> from the Firebug console and play ''snd/boom.wav''. Neat. But I still can''t play the same sample multiple times. It seems that the &lt;audio&gt; element is really more of a streaming feature rather than something to play sound effects with.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a clever way to make this happen that I''m missing? Preferebly something within HTML5 and Javascript, because this experiment is focused on these two technologies. (And I lack any experience in Flash or Silverlight.)</p>\n\n<p>I should also mention that, my test environment is Firefox 3.5 on Ubuntu 9.10. The other browsers I''ve tried -- Opera, Midori, Chromium, Epiphany -- produced varying results. Some don''t play anything, and some throw exceptions.</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

What are the pros and cons?', '<div class="post-text" itemprop="description">\r\n        <p>Seems like the new <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is all the hype these days, especially since Firefox now supports it. News of this are popping up in blogs all over the place, and everyone seems to be excited. But what about?</p>\n\n<p>As much as I searched I could not find anything that would make it better than the good old Flash video. In fact, I see only problems with it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It will still be some time before all the browsers start supporting it, and much more time before most people upgrade;</li>\n<li>Flash is available already and everyone has it;</li>\n<li>You can couple Flash with whatever fancy UI you want for controlling the playback. I gather that the  tag will be controllable as well (via JavaScript probably), but will it be able to go fullscreen?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only two pros for a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag that I can see are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is more "semantic" - which probably holds no importance to a whole lot of people, including me;</li>\n<li>It is not dependent on a single commercial 3rd party entity (Adobe) - which I also don''t see as a compelling reason to switch, because free players and video converters are already available, and Adobe is not hindering the whole process in any way (it''s not in their interests even).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So... what''s the big deal?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>OK, so there is one more Pro... maybe. Support for mobile devices. Hard to say though. A number of thoughts race through my head about the subject:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How many mobile devices are actually able to decode video at a decent speed anyway, Flash or otherwise?</li>\n<li>How long until mainstream mobile devices get the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> support? Even if it is available through updates, how many people actually do that?</li>\n<li>How many people watch videos on web pages on their mobile phones at all?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As for the semantics part - I understand that search engines might be able to detect videos better now, but... what will they do with them anyway? OK, so they know that there is a video in the page. And? They can''t index a video! I''d like some more arguments here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just thought of another Cons. This opens up a whole new area of cross-browser incompatibility. HTML and CSS is quite messy already in this aspect. Flash at least is the same everywhere. But it''s enough for at least one major browser vendor to decide against the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag (can anyone say "Internet Explorer"?) and we have a nice new area of hell to explore.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Pro just came in. More competition = more innovation. That''s true. Giving Adobe more competition will probably force them to improve Flash in areas it has been lacking so far. Linux seems to be a weak spot for it, cited by many.</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

The reason is that the rendering thread has all the\n  style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript\n  includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before\n  continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering\n  thread can''t completely show the page, since it doesn''t have all the\n  styles it needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My actual testing reveals something quite different: </p>\n\n<h3>My test harness</h3>\n\n<p>I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources: </p>\n\n<pre><code>require ''rubygems''\nrequire ''eventmachine''\nrequire ''evma_httpserver''\nrequire ''date''\n\nclass Handler  &lt; EventMachine::Connection\n  include EventMachine::HttpServer\n\n  def process_http_request\n    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )\n\n    return unless @http_query_string\n\n    path = @http_path_info\n    array = @http_query_string.split("&amp;").map{|s| s.split("=")}.flatten\n    parsed = Hash[*array]\n\n    delay = parsed["delay"].to_i / 1000.0\n    jsdelay = parsed["jsdelay"].to_i\n\n    delay = 5 if (delay &gt; 5)\n    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay &gt; 5000)\n\n    delay = 0 if (delay &lt; 0) \n    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay &lt; 0)\n\n    # Block which fulfills the request\n    operation = proc do\n      sleep delay \n\n      if path.match(/.js$/)\n        resp.status = 200\n        resp.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/javascript"\n        resp.content = "(function(){\n            var start = new Date();\n            while(new Date() - start &lt; #{jsdelay}){}\n          })();"\n      end\n      if path.match(/.css$/)\n        resp.status = 200\n        resp.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/css"\n        resp.content = "body {font-size: 50px;}"\n      end\n    end\n\n    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled\n    callback = proc do |res|\n        resp.send_response\n    end\n\n    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request\n    EM.defer(operation, callback)\n  end\nend\n\nEventMachine::run {\n  EventMachine::start_server("0.0.0.0", 8081, Handler)\n  puts "Listening..."\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, <code>http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500</code> gives me a 500&nbsp;ms delay transferring the CSS. </p>\n\n<p>I use the following page to test.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;script type=''text/javascript''&gt;\n          var startTime = new Date();\n      &lt;/script&gt;\n      &lt;link href="http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;\n      &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://10.0.0.50:8081/test2.js?delay=400&amp;amp;jsdelay=1000"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; \n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Elapsed time is: \n      &lt;script type=''text/javascript''&gt;\n        document.write(new Date() - startTime);\n      &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;    \n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5&nbsp;seconds to render: </p>\n\n<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDgrs.png" alt="CSS first"></p>\n\n<p>When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4&nbsp;seconds to render: </p>\n\n<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5o5SG.png" alt="JavaScript first"></p>\n\n<p>I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet&nbsp;Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.</p>\n\n<p>What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time. </p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct? </p>\n\n<p><sub>It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.</sub></p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

If the table was all one color, this wouldn''t be a problem since I could just make the top and bottom td corners rounded for the first and last row respectively. However, I am using different background colors for the table to differentiate the headings and for striping, so the inner td elements would show their rounded corners as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary of proposed solutions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Surrounding the table with another element with round corners doesn''t work because the table''s square corners "bleed through."</p>\n\n<p>Specifying border width to 0 doesn''t collapse the table.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom td corners still square after setting cellspacing to zero.</p>\n\n<p>Using javascript instead- works by avoiding the problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible solutions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The tables are generated in php, so I could just apply a different class to each of the outer th/tds and style each corner separately. I''d rather not do this, since it''s not very elegant and a bit of a pain to apply to multiple tables, so please keep suggestions coming.</p>\n\n<p>Possible solution 2 is to use javascript (jQuery, specifically) to style the corners. This solution also works, but still not quite what I''m looking for (I know I''m picky). I have two reservations: 1) this is a very lightweight site, and I''d like to keep javascript to the barest minimum 2) part of the appeal that using border-radius has for me is graceful degradation and progressive enhancement. By using border-radius for all rounded corners, I hope to have a consistently rounded site in CSS3-capable browsers and a consistently square site in others (I''m looking at you, IE).</p>\n\n<p>I know that trying to do this with CSS3 today may seem needless, but I have my reasons. I would also like to point out that this problem is a result of the w3c speficication, not poor CSS3 support, so any solution will still be relevant and useful when CSS3 has more widespread support.</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

I also learned that <a href="http://c-faq.com/stdio/scanfprobs.html">scanf</a> and <a href="http://c-faq.com/stdio/getsvsfgets.html">gets</a> are both UNSAFE and should NOT BE USED due to potential of buffer overflow.  So, I wrote this iteration using fgets, the safer alternative to gets.  Here are the pertinent lines for my fellow noobs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char input_line[MAX_LINE];\nchar *result;\n\n//&lt;snip&gt;\n\nwhile((result = fgets(input_line, MAX_LINE, stdin )) != NULL)    \n    line_count++;\nif (ferror(stdin))\n    perror("Error reading stdin.");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, here are the results using an even larger file (100M lines; ~3.4GB) on a fast server with very fast disk, comparing the python, the unsynced cin, and the fgets approaches, as well as comparing with the wc utility.  [The scanf version segfaulted and I don''t feel like troubleshooting it.]:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test.py \n0.03user 2.04system 0:28.06elapsed 7%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2464maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+182minor)pagefaults 0swaps\nRead 100000000 lines in 28 seconds.

I suspect that, at this point, other parts of the code will become the bottleneck, so I don''t think optimizing to that level would even be worthwhile, even if possible (since, after all, I actually need to store the read lines in memory).  </p>\n\n<p>Also note that a small tradeoff with using a char * buffer and fgets vs unsynced cin to string is that the latter can read lines of any length, while the former requires limiting input to some finite number.  In practice, this is probably a non-issue for reading most line-based input files, as the buffer can be set to a very large value that would not be exceeded by valid input. </p>\n\n<p>This has been educational.  Thanks to all for your comments and suggestions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As suggested by J.F. Sebastian in the comments below, the GNU wc utility uses plain C read() (within the safe-read.c wrapper) to read chunks (of 16k bytes) at a time and count new lines.  Here''s a python equivalent based on J.F.''s code (just showing the relevant snippet that replaces the python for loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BUFFER_SIZE = 16384 \ncount = sum(chunk.count(''\\n'') for chunk in iter(partial(sys.stdin.read, BUFFER_SIZE), ''''))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The performance of this version is quite fast (though still a bit slower than the raw c wc utility, of course:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test3.py \n0.01user 1.16system 0:04.74elapsed 24%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2448maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+181minor)pagefaults 0swaps\nRead 100000000 lines in 4.7275 seconds. LPS: 21152829\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, it''s a bit silly for me to compare C++ fgets/cin and the first python code on the one hand to wc -l and this last python snippet on the other, as the latter two don''t actually store the read lines but merely count newlines.  Still, it''s interesting to explore all the different implementations and think about the performance implications.  Thanks again!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 7: Tiny benchmark addendum and recap</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Hello HN readers!)   </p>\n\n<p>For completeness, I thought I''d update the read speed for the same file on the same box with the original (synced) C++ code.

This problem has a couple consequences… in an IDE, it means that when I try to browse to the source of this method being called… I get taken to an interface instead of some code that I can look at and see what is going on. This bothers me a lot, but also this is a real problem to me to hide where the implementation is coming from (sometimes it can be in non-obvious locations).</li>\n<li>It adds ANOTHER file to the system. It is  required double maintenance(e.g. adding a new method to the class and to the corresponding interface). I tend to be a minimalist in my programming… if I don''t really need another method, or another class, or even another file… not unless that extra thing is justified (flexibility that is going to be used, or makes the design cleaner, or provides some real benefit).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>UPDATE: a few quotes that share the concern:</p>\n\n<p>From <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/12/02/InterfacesAreNotAbstractions.aspx">http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/12/02/InterfacesAreNotAbstractions.aspx</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do you extract interfaces from your classes to enable loose\n  coupling? If so, you probably have a 1:1 relationship between your\n  interfaces and the concrete classes that implement them.\n  That’s probablynot a good sign, and violates the <a href="http://www.codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=934">Reused Abstractions\n  Principle (RAP)</a>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Having only one implementation of a given interface is a code smell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InterfaceImplementationPair.html">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InterfaceImplementationPair.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Using interfaces when you aren''t going to have multiple\n  implementations is extra effort to keep everything in sync.Furthermore\n  it hides the cases where you actually do provide multiple\n  implementations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p> \nFrom <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2008/10/20/dependency-inversion-abstraction-does-not-mean-interface/">http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2008/10/20/dependency-inversion-abstraction-does-not-mean-interface/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  never states that we should\n  depend on explicit interfaces...

What does creating the interface do that just overriding the class won''t do? What is so bad about having a mock that merely overrides some methods of the single implementation class?</p>\n\n<p>I guess it should be no surprise then that I much prefer Java''s default virtual methods (ie requiring a final keyword to have a method that CAN''T be overriden) to C#''s default final methods… and I also tend to avoid the final keyword on methods and classes too. Introducing virtual methods are not ideal, but less-intrusive approach to support mocking compare to duplicated interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>So is there something to using interfaces that I am missing? Is there some hidden benefit of using an interface when you have 1 version of a class and no immediate need to create an interface? What could be justifications, why some developers insist to create interface for each class?</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL);

below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After exhaustive testing, I found that adding <code>0.5</code> to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.</li>\n<li>The <a href="http://www.codemaestro.com/reviews/9">John Carmack hack</a> was faster, but it gave incorrect results starting at n=410881.  However, as suggested by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/38426/bobbyshaftoe">BobbyShaftoe</a>, we can use the Carmack hack for n &lt; 410881.</li>\n<li>Newton''s method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.  This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton''s Method, but implemented in the hardware so it''s much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton''s Method still required use of doubles.</li>\n<li>A modified Newton''s method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.</li>\n<li>Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The one suggestion which did show improvements was made by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/25188/john-d-cook">John D. Cook</a>.  You can observe that the last hex digit (i.e. the last 4 bits) of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9.  This means that 75% of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares.  Implementing this solution resulted in about a 50% reduction in runtime.</p>\n\n<p>Working from John''s suggestion, I investigated properties of the last <em>n</em> bits of a perfect square.  By analyzing the last 6 bits, I found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits.  This means 81% of values can be eliminated without using any math.  Implementing this solution gave an additional 8% reduction in runtime (compared to my original algorithm).  Analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code that I have used, which runs in 42% of the time required by the original algorithm (based on a run over the first 100 million integers).  For values of <em>n</em> less than 410881, it runs in only 29% of the time required by the original algorithm.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)\n{\n  if (n &lt; 0)\n    return false;\n\n  switch((int)(n &amp; 0x3F))\n  {\n  case 0x00: case 0x01: case 0x04: case 0x09: case 0x10: case 0x11:\n  case 0x19: case 0x21: case 0x24: case 0x29: case 0x31: case 0x39:\n    long sqrt;\n    if(n &lt; 410881L)\n    {\n      //John Carmack hack, converted to Java.\n      // See: http://www.codemaestro.com/reviews/9\n      int i;\n      float x2, y;\n\n      x2 = n * 0.5F;\n      y  = n;\n      i  = Float.floatToRawIntBits(y);\n      i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i &gt;&gt; 1 );\n      y  = Float.intBitsToFloat(i);\n      y  = y * ( 1.5F - ( x2 * y * y ) );\n\n      sqrt = (long)(1.0F/y);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      //Carmack hack gives incorrect answer for n &gt;= 410881.\n      sqrt = (long)Math.sqrt(n);\n    }\n    return sqrt*sqrt == n;\n\n  default:\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to John''s tests, using <code>or</code> statements is faster in C++ than using a <code>switch</code>, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between <code>or</code> and <code>switch</code>.</li>\n<li>I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or <code>or</code> statement, I would just say <code>if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;</code>.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower.  <del>I''m not sure why.</del>  This is because <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/299079/why-is-this-code-with-several-or-statements-slightly-faster-than-using-a-lookup-t#299205">array bounds are checked in Java</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

Rails does this by default when it adds <code>//= require_tree .</code> to the bottom of your <code>application.js</code> manifest file. </p>\n\n<p>This sounds like a real life-saver, but I am a little concerned about page-specific javascript code. Does this code get executed on every page? The last thing I want is for all of my objects to be instantiated for every page when they are only needed on 1 page. </p>\n\n<p>Also, isn''t there potential for code that clashes too?</p>\n\n<p>Or do you put a small <code>script</code> tag at the bottom of the page that just calls into a method that executes the javascript code for the page?</p>\n\n<p>Do you no longer need require.js then?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I appreciate all the answers... and I don''t think they are really getting at the problem. Some of them are about styling and don''t seem to relate... and others just mention <code>javascript_include_tag</code>... which I know exists (obviously...) but it would appear that the Rails 3.1 way going forward is to wrap up all of your Javascript into 1 file rather than loading individual Javascript at the bottom of each page.</p>\n\n<p>The best solution I can come up with is to wrap certain features in <code>div</code> tags with <code>id</code>s or <code>class</code>es. In the javascript code, you just check if the <code>id</code> or <code>class</code> is on the page, and if it is, you run the javascript code that is associated with it. This way if the dynamic element is not on the page, the javascript code doesn''t run - even though it''s been included in the massive <code>application.js</code> file packaged by Sprockets.</p>\n\n<p>My above solution has the benefit that if a search box is included on 8 of the 100 pages, it will run on only those 8 pages. You also won''t have to include the same code on 8 of the pages on the site. In fact, you''ll never have to include manual script tags on your site anywhere ever again.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is the actual answer to my question.</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>cans</strong> (note that I''m stressing the word cans, you''ll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/irQtR.png" alt="Template matching"></p>\n\n<p>Some contraints on the project:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>\n<li>The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits)</li>\n<li>The image could have some degree of fuziness (contours could be not really straight)</li>\n<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can !</li>\n<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can''t rely "too much" on color detection.</li>\n<li>The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle (and possibly partly hidden behind the bottle !)</li>\n<li>There could be no cans at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Byw82.png" alt="Total fail"></p>\n\n<p>Now I''ve done this project obviously as it was a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: Regarding image pre-processing I mean how to transform it in a more raw form to give to the algorithm. I used 2 methods:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Changing color domain from RGB to HSV (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">Hue Saturation Value</a>) and filtering based on "red" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with).\n<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ktdAB.png" alt="Binarized image"></li>\n<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>\n<li>Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F9319.png" alt="Contour detection"></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this (awesome) <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0123725380">book on feature extraction</a> and called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>\n<li>It is resistent to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>\n<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will "learn".</li>\n<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you''ll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below.</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wxrT1.png" alt="GHT"></p>\n\n<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong> ! I''m not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obvisouly because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>\n<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>\n<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>\n<li>Invariance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn''t recognized.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Can you help me improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively</strong> OpenCV features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentionned?</p>\n\n<p>I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn :)</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),

I also learned that <a href="http://c-faq.com/stdio/scanfprobs.html">scanf</a> and <a href="http://c-faq.com/stdio/getsvsfgets.html">gets</a> are both UNSAFE and should NOT BE USED due to potential of buffer overflow.  So, I wrote this iteration using fgets, the safer alternative to gets.  Here are the pertinent lines for my fellow noobs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char input_line[MAX_LINE];\nchar *result;\n\n//&lt;snip&gt;\n\nwhile((result = fgets(input_line, MAX_LINE, stdin )) != NULL)    \n    line_count++;\nif (ferror(stdin))\n    perror("Error reading stdin.");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, here are the results using an even larger file (100M lines; ~3.4GB) on a fast server with very fast disk, comparing the python, the unsynced cin, and the fgets approaches, as well as comparing with the wc utility.  [The scanf version segfaulted and I don''t feel like troubleshooting it.]:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test.py \n0.03user 2.04system 0:28.06elapsed 7%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2464maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+182minor)pagefaults 0swaps\nRead 100000000 lines in 28 seconds.

I suspect that, at this point, other parts of the code will become the bottleneck, so I don''t think optimizing to that level would even be worthwhile, even if possible (since, after all, I actually need to store the read lines in memory).  </p>\n\n<p>Also note that a small tradeoff with using a char * buffer and fgets vs unsynced cin to string is that the latter can read lines of any length, while the former requires limiting input to some finite number.  In practice, this is probably a non-issue for reading most line-based input files, as the buffer can be set to a very large value that would not be exceeded by valid input. </p>\n\n<p>This has been educational.  Thanks to all for your comments and suggestions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As suggested by J.F. Sebastian in the comments below, the GNU wc utility uses plain C read() (within the safe-read.c wrapper) to read chunks (of 16k bytes) at a time and count new lines.  Here''s a python equivalent based on J.F.''s code (just showing the relevant snippet that replaces the python for loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BUFFER_SIZE = 16384 \ncount = sum(chunk.count(''\\n'') for chunk in iter(partial(sys.stdin.read, BUFFER_SIZE), ''''))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The performance of this version is quite fast (though still a bit slower than the raw c wc utility, of course:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test3.py \n0.01user 1.16system 0:04.74elapsed 24%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2448maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+181minor)pagefaults 0swaps\nRead 100000000 lines in 4.7275 seconds. LPS: 21152829\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, it''s a bit silly for me to compare C++ fgets/cin and the first python code on the one hand to wc -l and this last python snippet on the other, as the latter two don''t actually store the read lines but merely count newlines.  Still, it''s interesting to explore all the different implementations and think about the performance implications.  Thanks again!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 7: Tiny benchmark addendum and recap</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Hello HN readers!)   </p>\n\n<p>For completeness, I thought I''d update the read speed for the same file on the same box with the original (synced) C++ code.

I have several years of experience with svn, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard that git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don''t see it.  Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell.  Now, I''m used to that from svn, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.</p>\n\n<p>My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations.  For example, here''s the workflow that he''s laid down:</p>\n\n<pre>\nclone the remote repo\ngit checkout -b my_new_feature\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..finish the feature\ngit checkout master\ngit merge my_new_feature\n</pre>\n\n<p>Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master.  Important to note is that the branch always stays local.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the workflow that I started with</p>\n\n<pre>\nclone remote repo\ncreate my_new_feature branch on remote repo\ngit checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature\n..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature\ngit merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)\n..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature\ngit merge master\n..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature\ngit checkout master\ngit merge my_new_feature\ndelete remote branch\ndelete local branch\n</pre>\n\n<p>There are 2 essential differences (I think):  I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repo.</p>\n\n<p>My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my worked backed up as I''m working.  Our repo is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong.  My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly.  Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that''s not mirrored somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p>My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature.  My gut feeling is that what I''m trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary.  I''ve even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell.  There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered.  The conflicts just made no sense to me.  It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn''t happy.</p>\n\n<p>What is the "correct" workflow for something like this?  Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I''m just not seeing it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2011-04-15</strong></p>\n\n<p>This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I''d update with my 2 years experience since I first asked.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:</p>\n\n<pre>\nclone the remote repo\ngit checkout -b my_new_feature\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..finish the feature\ngit checkout master\ngit merge my_new_feature\n</pre>\n\n<p>In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do <em>squash merges</em> instead of raw merges. This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they''re a little messy on our branches.

This brings me back to my original question (which I am still none the wiser about). How does one go about identifying where the problems lies?

Either way, I was thinking of using Google Code and SVN to share the source code of my projects instead of providing a link to the source on my website. This has always been a pain because I had to update the binaries and the code every time I released a new version. This would also help me to have a backup of my code some where instead of just my local machine (I used to have a local Subversion server running).</p>\n\n<p>What I want from a service like this is very simple... <strong>I just want a place to store my source code that people can download if they want, that allows me to control revisions and provide a simple and easy issue/bug system so people can submit bugs and stuff like that.</strong> I guess both of them have this.</p>\n\n<p>But I don''t want to host any binaries in their websites. I want this to be hosted on my website so I can control download statistics with my own scripts. I also don''t have a need for wiki pages as I prefer to have all the documentation on my own website. Do any of these services provide a way to "disable" features like wiki and downloads and not show them at all for my project(s)?</p>\n\n<p>Now, I''m sure there are lots of pros and cons about using Google Code with SVN and GitHub with Git (of course) but here''s what''s important for me on each one, and why I like them:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Google Code:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As with any Google page, the complexity is almost non-existent</li>\n<li>Everyone (or almost everyone) has a Google account, whcih is nice if people want to report problems using the issues system</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>GitHub:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>May (or may not) be a little more complex (not a problem for me though) than Google''s pages but...</li>\n<li>...has a much prettier interface than Google''s service</li>\n<li>It needs people to be registered on GitHub to post about issues</li>\n<li>I like the fact that with Git, you have your own revisions locally (can I use TortoiseGit for this or?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Basically that''s it. Not much, I know...</p>\n\n<p>What other common pros and cons can you tell me about each site/software? Keep in mind that my projects are simple, I''m probably the only one who will ever develop these projects on these repositories (or maybe not, but for now I am).</p>\n\r\n    </div>', NULL, NULL),
